List all matches in a navigatable list            *list_all_matches*

You can list all matches using either {vimgrep} or {grep}. Vimgrep will use
the internal regex engine, and grep will use whatever {grepprg} is set to.

When you run these, they will populate the quickfix list, which is global to
all instances of vim. Instead, you can prefix with {l} to get the
location-list version, which is local to each vim instance/window.

All matches for the current file                  *matches_for_current_file*

Example: >
  :vimgrep /pattern/ %
